## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. **Frontend (client/)**
- Built with React for a fast, interactive user experience.
- Uses React Router for seamless navigation.
- Axios handles all API requests to the backend.
- Modern CSS (Tailwind or CSS Modules) ensures a beautiful, responsive UI.
- Features include authentication, question/answer posting, search, filtering, and pagination.

### 2. **Backend (server/)**
- Node.js with Express provides RESTful API endpoints.
- Connects to MongoDB for persistent storage.
- Handles user authentication, validation, and CRUD operations for questions and answers.
- Implements error handling and input validation for robust operation.

### 3. **Database (MongoDB)**
- Stores users, questions, and answers in separate collections.
- Each question and answer is timestamped and linked to a user.

### 4. **Communication**
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API endpoints using Axios.
